# seril
Object serialization library for C++.

The library allows you to do the following things:
   1. serialize object instances;
   2. deserialize object instances.

Object states are serialized in a platform independent manner so it is possible to serialize an object in one platform and restore it later in another. Serialization also takes care of types and saves other necessary information so that the serialization process is smooth and reliable as possible.
